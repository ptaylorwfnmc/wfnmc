<h1><IMG SRC = "picbhn2000.jpg" ALT="[BH Neumann]" ></h1>
<font size=+1 color="#0000ff"><B>VALE BH NEUMANN 1909-2002</b></font>
<P>Emeritus Professor Bernhard Hermann Neumann, who provided the greatest 
inspirational influence in mathematics in Australia over a 40-year period, died 
in Canberra on 21 October 2002 not long after happily celebrating his 93rd birthday.</p> 

<P>He first visited Australia for three months in 1959, during sabbatical 
leave, and fell in love with the country. So when, late in 1960, he was invited 
to found a Department of Mathematics in the research-focussed Australian National 
University, he was receptive to the idea. Within days of his permanent arrival 
on 2 October 1962, he also became involved in activities supporting the teaching 
of mathematics in schools.</P>

<P>Bernhard had a great influence in the founding and administration of the 
Australian Mathematics Trust. He became a mentor and source of inspiration 
to Peter O’Halloran (1931-1994) who, while on the staff of the Canberra College 
of Advanced Education (later the University of Canberra) during the period of 
the early 1970s to the early 1990s, is acknowledged as the Founder of the 
Trust. Peter gained great strength from Bernhard’s encouragement, not only 
while Bernhard held his position as head of mathematics in the Institute of 
Advanced Studies at the Australian National University, but also after 
Bernhard’s retirement.</P>

<P>Bernhard took an active personal part in the Trust’s activities. He 
was the Inaugural Chairman of the Australian Mathematical Olympiad Committee, 
a position he held from 1980 to 1986. He was also the representative of the 
Canberra Mathematical Association (a sponsor of the Australian Mathematics 
Competition (AMC) for the Westpac Awards) on first the AMC Governing Board, 
and then on the Advisory Committee of the Trust. He was an active member of 
the Advisory Committee until his death.</P>

<P>Bernhard was also the principal inspiration behind the founding of other 
mathematics organisations. For example, he was the founding President of the 
Canberra Mathematical Association and the Australian Association of Mathematics 
Teachers (AAMT).</P>

<P>Bernhard's continual and effective promotion of mathematics among students 
of all ages, combined with his interest in and support for mathematics education 
at all levels, was significant and together profound in its impact upon all 
aspects of mathematics in Australia.</P>

<P>Early in 1998 the Australian Academy of Science arranged an interview with 
Bernhard as part of its Video Histories of Australian Scientists program. 
An edited transcript is available 
on-line <a href ="http://www.science.org.au/scientists/bn.htm">here</a>. 
This contains a clear and detailed account of his personal life and career 
in Mathematics up to that time.</P>

<P>Very briefly, he was born on 15 October 1909 in Berlin and grew up there. He 
studied at Freiburg and Berlin and earned his doctorate in 1931, making him one 
of the youngest ever to receive this award in mathematics from a German university. The 
difficult economic and political situation, especially related to race, caused 
him to leave for England in 1933, where he undertook a PhD at Cambridge completed 
in 1935. The employment situation was difficult and it was late 1937 before he 
began a university career at Cardiff. He was then, with the onset of World War 
2, interned as an alien and later recruited into the British military, first 
in the Pioneers and finally in Intelligence. He recommenced his university 
career in Hull in 1946 and then in 1948 moved to Manchester where later he 
became a Reader. He earned various honours including the Adams Prize (1951) 
and election to the Royal Society of London (1959).</P>

<P>In 1938 he married Hanna von Cämmerer after a long secret engagement. They 
raised five children under the sometimes difficult domestic arrangements associated 
with two careers. The children have all had successful careers; one of them, Peter, 
became a Fellow of The Queen’s College, University of Oxford and Chairman of the 
United Kingdom Mathematics Trust (a similar body to the Australian Mathematics 
Trust). At the same time as Bernhard's Canberra appointment, Hanna was offered a 
Readership at ANU. She arrived in August 1963 and within a year became the 
foundation Professor of Pure Mathematics, where her primary responsibility was 
undergraduate teaching. She rapidly involved herself with mathematics teaching in 
schools and with the AAMT.</p>

<P>Bernhard was the author of over a hundred research papers. Most of his work was 
in group theory. He also worked in other branches of algebra and sometimes in 
geometry. One notable example of the latter is the Douglas-Neumann Theorem, an 
extension of Napoleon's theorem discovered independently by Bernhard and the 
Fields Medallist, Jesse Douglas.</P>

<P>Bernhard's department raised the visibility of Australia in the mathematics 
community and mathematics in Australia.  It provided strong graduate training, 
producing over 50 PhDs by the time he retired from ANU in 1974. Many of these 
graduates went on to senior positions and some to very active roles in mathematics 
education.</p>

<P>He was one of the few people who had attended all ICME conferences from ICME-1 
(1969) in Lyon, ICME-2 (1972) in Exeter, ICME-3 (1976) (Karlsruhe) up to and including 
ICME-7 (1992) in Quebec.</p>

<P>Bernhard was elected to the Australian Academy of Science in 1964. In that 
context he made significant contributions to mathematics education, primarily 
through vitalising the Australian Subcommission of the International 
Commission on Mathematical Instruction (ICMI), serving as chairman and National 
Representative on ICMI. His visibility at the early International Congresses on 
Mathematical Education meant that he and other AAMT members were able to 
respond with enthusiasm to a suggestion (at Karlsruhe) that Australia host a 
forthcoming ICME. Intensive work, in which many AAMT members played decisive 
roles, led to the successful bid to hold the 1984 Congress in Adelaide and 
this conference was remarkably successful.</p>

<P>In addition he was active in getting the Academy involved in providing 
materials for schools; after a long gestation period, six volumes of <I>Mathematics 
at Work</I> appeared in 1980-1.</p>

<P>The main award of Australian Mathematics Trust recognises, in Bernhard’s name, 
people who have made significant contributions over many years to the enrichment 
of mathematics learning in Australia and its region. Until his death, Bernhard 
took an active interest in this award, travelling around Australia where necessary 
to present the awards (now restricted by quota to no more than three per year), 
always protecting the polish on the silver tray with his trademark white gloves.</p>

<P>The Australian Mathematics Trust also has another award in Bernhard’s name. 
Bernhard had a fascination for the ability of students who could achieve a 
perfect score in the Australian Mathematics Competition for the Westpac 
Awards, and such an achievement now merits a BH Neumann Certificate.</p>

<P>His involvement in Olympiad activities was wider than may have appeared on the 
surface. He became a member of the Executive Committee of ICMI (1979-82) and, 
chairing a Site Committee, ensured better structure and operation of the 
International Mathematical Olympiads. The holding of the 1988 IMO in Australia, 
in our bicentenary year, had much to thank him for.</p>

<P>He was also active in The Australian Mathematical Society; it awards prizes 
in his name, on the basis of research student presentations at its annual meetings.</p>

<P>In 1994 he was made a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) for service to 
the advancement of research and teaching in mathematics.</p>

<P>These important achievements are only to be weighed beside the many individual 
acts of advice and assistance that Bernhard, initially with Hanna and then with the 
complete support of his second wife, Dorothea, gave to all who sought this from him.
And they should be viewed in the light of many other activities including cycling, 
cello-playing, chess and exploring the countryside.</P>

<P>May the memory of him as a warm and influential person, and of his many contributions 
to mathematics, to mathematics education, and the organisations activities he 
helped found, serve to stimulate us all!</p>

available on the Academy's website and can be found by clicking
