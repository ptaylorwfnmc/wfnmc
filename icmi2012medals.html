<P>THe following announcement has been made by ICMI ...</p>
<P><font size=+1 color="#0000ff"><B>ANNOUNCEMENT</b></font></p>
<P><font color="#0000ff"><B>2011 ICMI Medallists</b></font></P>
<P>We take great pleasure in announcing that the ICMI Award Committee has
decided on the Medallists for 2011.</p>
<P>They are:</p>

<P>Felix Klein Medal for lifetime achievement:  Alan Schoenfeld
Hans Freudenthal Medal for a major cumulative programme of research:
Luis Radford.</p>

<P>Please join with us in congratulating both Alan and Luis, and
acknowledging their fine contributions to mathematics
education and therefore to the mathematics education community.
We look forward to honouring them at ICME-12 in Seoul later this year
when full citations will be announced.</p>

<P><font color="#0000ff"><B>Alan H. Schoenfeld, University of California at Berkeley, USA</B></font></p>
<P>The Felix Klein Medal for 2011 is given to the Elizabeth and Edward
Connor Professor of Education and Affiliated Professor of Mathematics,
Alan H. Schoenfeld, University of California at Berkeley, USA, in
recognition of his more than thirty years of sustained, outstanding
lifetime achievements in mathematics education research and
development. Alan Schoenfeld  developed a keen interest in mathematics
education early in his career, and emerged as a leader in research on
mathematical problem solving. He shows a life-long pursuit of deeper
understanding of the nature and development of mathematical learning
and teaching. His work has helped to shape research and theory
development in these areas, making a seminal impact on subsequent
research. Alan Schoenfeld has also done fundamental theoretical and
applied work that connects research and practice in assessment,
mathematical curriculum, diversity in mathematics education, research
methodology, and teacher education. He has more than 200 highly-cited
publications in mathematics education, mathematics, educational
research, and educational psychology. His scholarship is of the
highest quality, reflected in esteemed recognition over the years.
Alan Schoenfeld has nurtured a generation of new scholars who generate
increasing impact on mathematics education research. He has undertaken
a remarkable amount of outstanding work for national, regional, and
international communities in education, mathematics, and mathematics
education, providing leadership in professional associations and joint
research endeavors, and has been an invited keynote speaker at
numerous conferences around the globe.</p>
<P>Alan Schoenfeld began his career as a research mathematician. After
obtaining a B.A. in mathematics from Queen’s College, New York, in
1968, and an M.S in mathematics from Stanford University in 1969, he
earned a PhD in mathematics at Stanford in 1973. He became a lecturer
at the University of California at Davis in 1973, and in 1975 a
lecturer and research mathematician in the Graduate Group in Science
and Mathematics Education (SESAME) at the University of California at
Berkeley. After academic appointments at Hamilton College (1978-1981)
and the University of Rochester (1981-1984), Alan Schoenfeld was
invited back to U.C. Berkeley in 1985 to develop the mathematics
education group. He has been a full professor since 1987, and now has
a named chair in education and is an affiliated professor in the
mathematics department. He has also been a Special Professor of the
University of Nottingham since 1994.</p>
<P>He has been an elected member of the U.S. National Academy of
Education since 1994, a member of its Executive Board in 1995, and
Vice President in 2001. He also served as the President of American
Educational Research Association (AERA) in1998/9. In 2000 he led the
writing team for Principles and Standards for School Mathematics for
the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.</p>
<P>Amongst Alan Schoenfeld’s many publications we mention his
highly-cited, groundbreaking book, Mathematical Problem Solving
(1985), his chapter on cognition and metacognition, Learning to think
mathematically: Problem solving, metacognition, and sense-making in
mathematics (in the 1992 Handbook for Research on Mathematics Teaching
and Learning), his rigorous study of the development and learning of a
complex mathematical idea, Learning (1993, co-authored with J.P. Smith
and A.A. Arcavi), his finely-detailed work on teacher decision making,
Toward a theory of teaching-in-context (published in Issues in
Education in 1998), and his most recent book, How We Think (2010).
Alan Schoenfeld’s seminal theoretical contributions are all based on,
and buttressed by, long sequences of carefully designed experiments
and their exhaustive analysis.</p>

<font color="#0000ff"><B>Luis Radford, Université Laurentienne, Sudbury, Canada</b></font>
<P>The Hans Freudenthal Medal for 2011 is given to Professor Luis
Radford, Université Laurentienne, Canada, in recognition of the
theoretically well-conceived and highly coherent research programme
over the past two decades which has had a significant impact on the
community. His development of a semiotic-cultural theory of learning
has been anchored in detailed observations of students’ algebraic
activity. His research, has been documented extensively in renowned
scientific journals, books and handbooks, as well as in numerous
invited keynote presentations. The impact of Luis Radford’s programme
of research has led to significant new insights in algebra teaching
and learning, and more boadly, with his development of a widely
applicable theory of learning.</p>
<P>Luis Radford has given many mentoring workshops for graduate students
Italy, Spain, Denmark, Colombia, Mexico, and Brazil. He has influenced
teachers, teacher educators, and curriculum developer. He has served
as associate editor of For the Learning of Mathematics and is
currently an associate editor of Educational Studies in Mathematics.
Luis Radford graduated from the Universidad de San Carlos in Guatemala
in 1977 with a degree in Civil Engineering. He then taught at that
university’s Engineering School, followed by studies at Université
Louis Pasteur I, Strasbourg, France, where he obtained a Licence in
Mathematics and Fundamental Applications in 1981, a Diplôme of
Advanced Studies in Mathematical Didactics in 1983, and a Doctorat de
troisième cycle in Mathematical Didactics in 1985. He then returned to
Guatemala where he taught as an Associate Professor at the Universidad
de San Carlos in the Humanities Faculty. In 1992, he moved to Canada
where he obtained a position in the School of Education at Université
Laurentienne, Sudbury, Ontario, as Full Professor.</p>
<p>Luis Radford’s research programme can be traced back to the early
1990s when he initiated a study that examined the role of
historical-epistemological analyses of learning within a
socio-cultural perspective. His work continued to evolve, drawing upon
the works of Vygotsky, Bakhtin, and Voloshinov to develop a
semiotic-cultural framework to investigate the ways in which students
use signs and endow them with meaning in their initial encounters with
algebra. In further development he elaborated the notion that thinking
is a sensuous and sign-mediated reflective activity embodied in the
corporeality of actions, gestures, and artifacts, leading to a
formulation of knowing and being as mutually constitutive. Luis
Radford has more than 170 publications, many of them highly cited.
Luis Radford’s research programme was ranked first in three
consecutive competitions of the Social Sciences and Humanities
Research Council of Canada (Education 1): 2004-2007, 2007-2010, and
2010-2013.</p>

<P>Thank you very much for your cooperation.</p>
<P>Cordially,
<BR>Jaime Carvalho e Silva
<br>Secretary-General of ICMI</p>
