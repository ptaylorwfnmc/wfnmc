<font size=+1 color="#0000ff"><B>Obituary: Peter Joseph O'Halloran (1931-1994)</b></font>
<p>The death occurred on 25 September 1994 of Peter O'Halloran, 
founder of the Australian Mathematics Competition and a 
range of national and international mathematics enrichment 
activities.</p>

<p>Peter was born in Sydney on 27 April, 1931, the 
youngest of a family of four boys and three girls. 
His father died when he was four years old, leaving 
the family in poor circumstances. His mother took in 
boarders to make ends meet and put several of the 
children through University.</p>

<p>Peter attended Marist Brothers School in Kogarah, 
Sydney, and it was there that he developed his 
life-long fascination with mathematics. He went 
on to the University of Sydney, on a government 
teaching scholarship, where he graduated with a 
Bachelor of Science and Diploma of Education.</p> 

<p>Peter married Marjorie in 1955 and  taught mathematics 
in several high schools in Sydney and the country 
regions. At Manly Boys High School, which had a 
noted discipline problem at the time, Peter also 
coached the Rugby Union and Rugby League teams, 
both with high degrees of success.</p>

<p>In 1965 Peter became head of mathematics at the 
Royal Australian Navy Academy at Jervis Bay. It was 
there that he completed a Master of Science, 
specialising in oceanography.</p>

<p>In 1970, now with four children, Peter and 
Marjorie moved to Canberra. Peter was one of 
the original appointments at the Canberra 
College of Advanced Education (later to become 
the University of Canberra) and taught in the 
first official semester of the CCAE. At the CCAE 
Peter developed other interests, including 
operations research and what was to become 
his main interest, discrete mathematics.</p>

<p>In 1972/3 he was the first CCAE academic to 
take study leave. Part of this was taken at 
the University of Waterloo, Canada, where he 
gained the idea of a broadly based mathematics 
competition for high school students. On his 
return he often enthused to his colleagues 
about the potential value of such a 
competition in Australia.</p>

<p>In 1976, while President of the Canberra Mathematical 
Association, he established a committee to run a 
mathematics competition in Canberra. This was so 
successful that the competition became national 
by 1978 as the Australian Mathematics Competition, 
sponsored by the Bank of New South Wales (now 
Westpac Banking Corporation). It is now well-known 
that this competition has grown to over 500,000 
entries annually, and is probably the biggest 
mass-participation event in the country.</p>

<p>In 1979 he established the Australian Mathematical 
Olympiad Committee.The activities of this committee 
have grown to a complex web of competition and 
enrichment activities, at the highest level 
culminating each year  in Australia's participation 
in the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). 
Australia has participated internationally with 
distinction, for example this year being placed 
12th out of 69 countries.</p>

<p>In 1983 Peter founded University of Canberra 
Mathematics Day, based on a similar event he 
had seen in America. This is now well-established 
and supports similar days in other parts of 
Australia. It has in turn become a model for 
other Mathematics Days throughout the world.</p>

<p>In 1984 Peter founded the World Federation of 
National Mathematics Competitions. For several 
years the main activity of the WFNMC was the 
production of a Journal, which acted as a vital 
line of communication for people trying to set 
up similar activities in other countries. In recent 
years its activities have expanded to include an 
international conference and a set of international 
awards (the Hilbert and Erd&ouml;s Awards, to recognise 
mathematicians prominent in enriching mathematics 
education. Most recently, the WFNMC has become a 
Special Interest Group of the International 
Commission on Mathematical Instruction (ICMI).</p>

<p>One of the highlights of Peter's career was hosting 
the 1988 IMO in Canberra, which attracted a record 
number of countries at the time and set new standards 
in many aspects of organisation.</p>

<p>In 1989 Peter established the Asia Pacific 
Mathematics Olympiad, providing a regional 
Olympiad for countries in the dynamic Pacific rim area.</p>

<p>In 1990 Peter completed the spectrum of competitions 
and enrichment activities in Australia, with 
the range of Challenge and Enrichment activities 
now organised by the Australian Mathematical Olympiad Committee.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most significant event in Peter's career 
in the last two or three years was his role in the 
establishment of the Australian Mathematics Trust, 
which is an umbrella body administering all the 
activities with which he has been associated and 
which are referred to above.</p>

<p>Peter's last main duty was to preside at the 
WFNMC conference in Bulgaria in July 1994. 
It was obvious to all who were there that 
Peter was ill. It was generally thought that 
he was experiencing another bout of pleuro-pneumonia, 
from which he had suffered in 1993. On his return home 
however further tests revealed that Peter's condition 
was much more serious, and cancer was diagnosed. 
He spent most of his last month at home.</p>

<p>On 31 August he was presented with the David Hilbert 
Award, which he had declined to accept earlier in 
the year while still president of the WFNMC. 
A small party of 30 to 40 of Peter's relatives 
and local colleagues were in attendance at his home. 
The David Hilbert Award is the highest international 
award of the WFNMC and in Peter's case was awarded 
for &quot;his significant contribution to the enrichment 
of mathematics learning at an international level&quot;.</p>

<p>On 19 September he was awarded the  World Cultural 
Council's &quot;Jose Vasconcelos&quot; World Award for 
Education at a ceremony at Chambery, France.  
This award &quot;is granted to a renowned educator, 
an authority in the field of teaching or to a 
legislator of education policies who has a 
significant influence on the advancement in 
the scope of culture for mankind&quot;. The qualifying 
jury is formed by several members of the 
interdisciplinary Committee (of the World 
Cultural Council) and a group of distinguished 
educators.</p>

<p>Due to his illness Peter was unable to travel. 
Instead his eldest daughter Genevieve and son 
Anthony travelled to Chambery to receive the 
Award on his behalf. Fortunately Peter was 
still alive on 23 September on their return 
to Australia and was able to receive the 
award in person.</p>

<p>Peter was also recognised in many other ways 
throughout his career. In 1983 he was awarded 
the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM), in 
1991 he was awarded a Doctor of Science (honoris 
causa) from Deakin University and in 1994 he was 
promoted to Professor in his own University.</p>

<p>Many mathematicians have made significant 
individual contributions to the subject itself. 
Peter's influence was much more direct, bringing 
mathematics to the world. With his driving energy 
and the institutions he created he has significantly 
increased people's awareness of mathematics 
and what it can do, throughout the world.</p>

<p>One of Peter's main concern in life was to 
assist the disadvantaged. He saw the AMC as 
being able to bring mathematics to children 
in remote places. In the earliest times of 
the AMC he travelled the Pacific and introduced 
the competition to a large number of island 
nations, such as Fiji, Tonga, Western Samoa, 
French Polynesia (for whom the paper was made 
available in French) and many smaller countries, 
some of which only had radio or occasional 
steamer contact with the outside world.</p>

<p>The Australian Government recognised these 
efforts and funded this project as one of 
the few cultural links between Australia 
and its Pacific neighbours.</p>

<p>Peter was proud of the fact that more than 
50\% of the AMC entrants were girls, but 
concerned that they did not get the same 
representation among the medals. He was 
also proud of the many letters he received 
from country schools, thankful for the 
opportunity to participate in the same event 
as their city cousins.</p>

<p>Peter saw the main advantage to be derived 
from the WFNMC was the help it could give to 
mathematics education in developing countries. 
I was seated next to him in a debate on the 
value of competitions at the 1992 International 
Conference on Mathematical Education in Quebec 
where he was payed the ultimate compliment to 
which he would have aspired. One delegate gave 
a well-planned attack on competitions, based 
on the usual lines, that competitions encouraged 
elitism, etc. In response, a delegate from the 
small African country of Malawi, unknown to 
Peter, responded with an emotional thank you 
to Peter and the people of the Australian 
Mathematics Competition for what they had made 
possible in her country. This was a most moving experience.</p>

<p>I made these observations to Peter's eldest brother 
Ted after Peter's funeral. Ted had become senior 
partner in one of Australia's largest law firms 
before going into semi-retirement and was both a 
father-figure and inspiration to Peter. Ted 
reflected on these comments and noted the 
similarity between Peter and another brother 
Michael (now deceased). Michael had gone into 
the Marist order and had shown the same 
concerns for the disadvantaged. He had become 
responsible in the order for the distribution 
of international aid. It was probably no 
coincidence that Peter's and Michael's paths 
once crossed. Several years ago they found 
themselves together on the same remote Pacific 
island, each going about their own separate tasks.</p>

<p>Peter, of course will be irreplaceable. 
Fortunately, however, he had the foresight 
to establish institutions in such a way that 
they all have the resources, particularly 
human resources, to ensure that the good 
work will continue.</p>

<p>Peter is survived by his wife Marjorie, 
four children and six grandchildren.</p>
