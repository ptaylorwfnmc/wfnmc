<H2>David Hilbert and Paul Erdös Awards</H2>
<p>The <A HREF = "wfnmc.html">World 
Federation of National Mathematics Competitions</a>
has created two international awards for mathematicians
who have contributed to mathematics enrichment in their
own countries or internationally.</p>
<P>They are named after two mathematicians who have been 
among the most prominent
in providing mathematical challenge in the twentieth century.</p>
<P><b>Note:</b> Since 1996 the Hilbert Award has <b>not</b> been awarded. It is the policy of WFNMC that the two awards
have been merged with the same status and with the Erdös name surviving. A quota of three such Erdös
Awards in each two-year period was also introduced from 1996.</p>
<HR>
<H2>David Hilbert Award</H2>
<P>The David Hilbert Award 
was established to recognise contributions of mathematicians
which have played a significant role 
in the development of mathematical 
challenges at the international level
and which have been a stimulus for the 
enrichment of mathematics learning.</P>
<P>Each recipient of the award is selected by the
Executive and Advisory Committee of the
<A HREF = "wfnmc.html">
World Federation of National Mathematics Competitions</a> 
on the recommendation
of the WFNMC Awards Subcommittee.</P>
<H3>David Hilbert (1862-1943)</H3>
David Hilbert was one of the most outstanding
mathematicians of the modern era.<P>
At the International Congress of 
Mathematicians in Paris in 1900 he presented
the now famous and inspirational 23 
problems which he challenged twentieth
century mathematicians to solve.<P>
"A mathematical problem should 
be difficult in order to entice us,
yet not completely inaccessible, lest 
it mock our efforts. It should be to us a guidepost
on the tortuous paths to hidden truths, 
ultimately rewarding us by the pleasure in
the successful solution." - David Hilbert.<P>

<H2>Paul Erdös Award</H2>
<P>The Paul Erdös Award is 
established to recognise contributions of mathematicians
which have played a significant role in the 
development of mathematical challenges at the national or international level
and which have been a stimulus for the 
enrichment of mathematics learning.</P>
<P>Each recipient of the award is selected by the

<H3>Paul Erdös (1913-1996)</H3>
<P><a href = "erdos.html">Paul Erdös</a>, born 
in 1913 in Hungary, was an indefatigable traveller, 
disseminating mathematics challenges
to researchers in many countries of the world.<P>
He authored or co-authored 1500 articles and books
and collaborated with more mathematicians than anyone in history.<p>
He died on Friday 20 September 1996 in Warsaw after suffering
a heart attack.</p>

<h2>Requirements for Nominations for the Paul Erdös Award</h2>
<p>The following documents and additional information must be writtten
in English:</P>
<ul>
<LI>A one or two page statement which includes the achievements
of the nominee and a description of the contribution by the nominee which
reflects the objectives of the WFNMC.</li>

is an international award and whereas all the work attributable to the candidate might be
entirely within one's own country the award is as viewed internationally and it is highly
recommended that one or two of the referees should be from other countries than the nominee.

<h4>Earlier Version of David Hilbert Award</h4>
<P>It should be noted that 1991 Awards under the name of David
Hilbert were presented
on the basis of quite different criteria, that of having written the most interesting 
articles written in the previous
years' volumes of the WFNMC Journal 
<A HREF = "http://www.win.tue.nl/win/ioi/imo/mathcomp.html">
"Mathematics Competitions"</a>.</p>
<H4>1991</H4>
<ul>
<LI><a href ="hilbarb.html">Edward Barbeau</a>, Canada. Ed's 1989 article, <i>Mathematics Contests: Time to take
Stock?</i> was a thought-provoking article reviewing the growth of contests and assessing their role
in the learning process for students of various types.</li>
<LI><a href = "hilenge.html">Arthur Engel</a>, Germany. Arthur wrote an-indepth article in 1987
on the issues of creating Mathematical Olympiad Problems, from a number of perspectives.</li>
<LI><a href = "hilpoll.html">Graham Pollard</a>, Australia. Graham's 1987 article <I>Two Methods of Reducing 
Guessing in Multiple Choice Competitions</i> proposed methods to reduce the impact of
guessing, such as allowing students to nominate answers known to be incorrect and tiering the paper.</li>
