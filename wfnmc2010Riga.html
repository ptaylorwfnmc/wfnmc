<P><font size=+1 color="#0000ff"><B>WORLD FEDERATION OF NATIONAL MATHEMATICS COMPETITIONS</b></font></P>
<P><font color="#0000ff"><B>WFNMC-6 Riga, Latvia, July 2010</b></font></p>
<P><B>Dates:</b> The congress will start on 25th July, Sunday (arrival) and
end on 31st July, Saturday (departure).</p>
<P>Immediately after the congress the 6th conference
<I>Creativity in math education and education of gifted
children</i> will start (1st August,  Sunday, will be the
arrival day). So it will be easy to attend both meetings.</p>
<P><B>Fees:</b> not yet known.</p>
<h4>WORK BEFORE CONFERENCE</h4>
<P>We will ask each participant to submit theses up to
one A4 page. An international program committee will review
them. In the case of acceptance the author(s) will be asked
to submit a full paper. The length of the paper will depend
on the decision of IPC.</p>
<P>We will ask each participant to submit 3 or so competition
problems (before the conference, but possibly later than
thesis) together with explanation WHY these problems seem
interesting/valuable to him/her. A special <I>problem book
committee</i> will consider them and prepare for joint work
during the congress.</p>
<h4>APPROXIMATE SCHEDULE</h4>
<P>From Monday until Friday there will be four working days and
one excursion day (this excursion will be on bus and take
at least 5-6 hours). At the morning of each working day we will
work in sections, including the work on the problems sent in
by the participants (or brought by them directly to the
congress). So we will prepare a draft version of the problem
book with extended comments, which will be published after
editing ( as one of the <I>hard outcomes</i> of the congress ).</p>
<P>After lunch there will be two plenary lectures. They will
consider both competition issues (we propose one plenary
lecture for each area, see later) and general mathematical
topics. After a middle-length break mini - conferences will
take place. We propose four areas in which they and the
sections will be organized:
<OL><li>a bridge between research mathematics ( theoretical
computer science ) and competitions,</li>
<li>competition problems and general methods of their solution,</li>
<LI>types and organization of the competitions,</li>
<LI>preparation of students and teachers.</li>
</OL>
<P>We see broad areas where the suggestions of people from
computer science could be valuable and thought-provoking,
e.g,. can we use problems whose solutions employ
databases? Maybe the fifth area <i>algorithmics</i> along
with algebra, geometry, combinatorics and number theory
should be introduced? etc.</p>
<P>More specifications will come when the proposals of the
eventual participants will start to arrive.</p>
<h4>SOCIAL ACTIVITY</h4>
<P>On each evening there will be some social event, e.g.,
opening banquet, closing banquet, concert, excursion through
old Riga possibly combined with a travel on a ship in
Daugava, etc.</p>
<h4>ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES</h4>
<P>They will include exhibitions (one of them will be the
exhibition of mathematical toys).</p>
<P>The International Mathematics Tournament
of Towns Meeting, meetings of WFNMC etc. will be scheduled.</p>
<P><B>Venue:</b> University of Latvia.</p>
<P><B>Climate:</b> 20 to 25 deg, mainly sunny, sea temp about 17 deg.</p>
