<h4>POLICY STATEMENT ON COMPETITIONS AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION</h4>
<h4>Definition of Scope of Competition Activities</h4>
<P>The scope of activities of interest to the WFNMC, although centred on 
competitions for students of all levels (primary, secondary and tertiary), 
is much broader than the competitions themselves. The WFNMC aims to provide 
a vehicle for educators to exchange information on a number of activities 
related to mathematics and mathematics learning. These activities include</p>
<ul>
<LI>Mathematical competitions of various kinds</li>
<LI>Mathematical aspects of problem creation and solution, a dynamic branch 
of mathematics.</li>
<LI>Research in mathematics education related or pertaining to competitions 
or the other types of activities listed here.</li>
<LI>Enrichment courses and activities in mathematics.</li>
<LI>Mathematics Clubs or “Circles”.</li>
<LI>Mathematics Days.</li>
<LI>Mathematics Camps, including live-in programs in which students solve 
open-ended or research-style problems over a period of days.</li>
<LI>Publication of Journals for students and teachers containing problem 
sections, book reviews, review articles on historic and contemporary issues 
in mathematics.</li>
<LI>Support for teachers who desire and/or require extra resources in dealing 
with talented students.</li>
<LI>Support for teachers, schools, regions and countries who desire to develop 
local, regional and national competitions.</li>
</ul>
<P>With qualification, WFNMC also facilitates communication through its Journal
and Conferences, in the following areas</p>
<UL>
<LI>Topics in informatics parallel to those in mathematics. This applies 
particularly in that no equivalent body exists for informatics. It takes 
into account that the disciplines are closely related, that many journals 
cover both topics, and that in many countries the organisation of 
competitions in mathematics and informatics, and mathematics and 
informatics themselves, are closely related.</li>
<LI>Recreational mathematics, including mathematical puzzles, particularly
as they might inspire the creation of mathematics problems.</li>
</ul>
<P>WFNMC is concerned with activities particularly when they have international 
significance or are significant within their own country.</p>
 
<h3>EFFECT ON TEACHING AND LEARNING</h3>

All of the above activities have a positive effect, direct or indirect, on 
the teaching and learning of mathematics and in attracting students to the study 
of mathematics. In particular the WFNMC highlights the following characteristics.</li>
<OL>
<LI><B>Two classes of competitions</B>
<P>Competitions generally fall into one of the following two categories, both of 
which have increased substantially in popularity over the past century, 
and particularly in the last three decades.</p>
<OL Type = "a">
<LI><B>Inclusive Competitions</B>
<P>These competitions are of a popular nature, designed for students of all standards, 
and certainly accessible to the student of average or below average standard. 
Such competitions give each student the opportunity to solve simple though 
often intriguing problems set in familiar circumstances. These competitions, 
aimed also at highlighting the importance of the curriculum, will not usually 
be set according to a published syllabus, but will often be checked by experienced 
teachers to ensure that the mathematical skills involved are within the scope 
of virtually all students in the countries or regions where the competitions 
are held.</p>
<P><B>Examples:</b> Multiple choice competitions such as exist in Australia, 
Europe (Kangaroo and UK Challenges) and North America (Canada and USA).
First rounds of National Olympiads as they are held in some countries.</p></li>
<LI><B>Exclusive Competitions</b>
<p>These Competitions are aimed at the talented student. Once again the syllabus of the 
competition is rarely formal, although past papers and other materials are often 
available as guidelines for new participants and their teachers. Because the 
subject of mathematics is so broad, there is vast material of a challenging 
nature which enables students to deepen their knowledge and command of 
mathematics without the need to accelerate their study. This can aid the 
talented student to mature intellectually and better equip him or her for 
later study or careers.</p> 
<P><B>Examples:</b> National and International Olympiads in 
Mathematics, ARML. Some of the related activities, such as mathematics 
camps, are often focused toward the talented student.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><B>Independence of Administration</b>
<P>Often such competitions are promoted independently of normal mathematics 
curricula and in fact usually outside the framework of the administration 
of the curriculum. As a result, competitions can be written by students 
without the pressure normally associated with the assessment process, 
giving students a means of discovering their talent without risk.</p></li>

<li><B>Competitions test ability to deal with unexpected situations</b>
<P>Competitions are usually held over many schools, sometimes in more than one 
country. As a result they are rarely in a position to test material freshly 
taught in the classroom, and are therefore likely to be directed toward a 
broad level of mathematics achievement and an ability to deal with 
problems or situations beyond usual experience or expectations. As 
a result competitions not only test direct mathematics knowledge and 
skill, but also the ability of the students to meet more general challenges 
in life. Similarly it can be observed that the associated activities of 
preparing for competitions involve the development of logical reasoning 
and thus the ability to deal with new situations.</p>

<P>The creation of problems that address unexpected situations explores 
profound interrelations among mathematical topics and arguments, or between 
mathematics and other academic or daily experiences, in effect constructing 
conceptual maps which underscore and delimit understanding and command of 
mathematical thinking as opposed to knowledge of topics, an aspect of 
competitions that makes a unique contribution to research in mathematics 
teaching and learning.</p>

<P>Competitions often expose students to types of mathematics not often offered in 
school, certainly including mathematics that can be exciting, surprising, elegant 
and beautiful. For many students competitions become a deciding factor in choosing 
mathematics as their profession. Thus, competitions can allow mathematicians to 
pass the baton to new generations of mathematicians, a critical element in the 
preservation of mathematics.</p></li>

<LI><B>Resources for Teachers</b>
<P>Competitions, especially those of the inclusive type as defined above, provide vast 
resources for the teacher and the class room.</p>
<P>Inclusive competitions usually have the items published later. These 
items are often sorted into mathematical topics and statistics, which give a 
clear guide to the level of difficulty.</p></li>

<LI><B>Opportunity for Interaction</b>
<P>Competitions provide a rare opportunity for teachers and academics to work 
together. They also provide a unique opportunity for academics and teachers 
to work with talented students.</p></li>
</OL> 

<h4>VOLUNTARY COMMITMENT OF TEACHERS</h4>
<P>The WFNMC notes that most competitions are dependent on the voluntary 
contribution of dedicated teachers and academics who are highly committed 
to their subjects, and often work long hours, much beyond the call of paid 
duty, in composing problems, working with students or marking scripts. 
These people serve professional societies or non-profit organisations which 
are equally committed to highlighting publicly the importance of mathematics.</p>

<P>The WFNMC supports programs that seek to provide recognition to those who 
contribute their expertise, time and effort to competitions and associated 
activities.</p>

<h4>SOME FURTHER COMMENTS</h4>
<UL>
<LI>Competitions inspire in many students a further interest in mathematics 
and increases their desire to learn more mathematics.</li>
<LI>Participation in competitions is often voluntary and can generally be 
done to a level chosen by the student.</li>
</ul>

<h4>CONCLUSIONS</h4>
<P>Through the preparation for competitions and the work with talented 
students a whole classical branch of mathematics is both preserved and 
developed. Without these activities this important mathematical heritage and 
treasure would die out very soon and the society will lose something 
important.</p>

<P>The work with talented students (preparation for competitions) reveals 
the frontiers of what could be given to school students, what the students 
could assimilate and, most importantly, didactical know-how is gathered 
helping to determine how this special and more difficult material could be 
transmitted to students. If one day such topics are to become (for one or 
another reason) a part of the curriculum (not necessarily in the usual 
schools) knowledge on how to do this will be available. In this respect 
the role of competitions is similar to the role played by car-races for 
the development of the car industry.</p>

<P>The preparation for competitions develops the minds of young people. 
As the physical efforts contribute to bodybuilding, the preparation for 
competitions serves "mind-building" which is often neglected in the 
modern society. Taking into account that in some competitions (earlier 
stages of national Olympiads) hundreds of thousands of students make 
"brain exercising" one understands that after the competition the human 
resource potential of the respective country is improved.</p>

<P>Competitions allow young people to compare their abilities and achievements 
in a very categorical way which is free of subjective opinions. This helps 
them make decisions about who they want to be professionally and what kind of 
career to pursue. It is difficult to overestimate the role of the WFNMC 
in this respect.</p>
