<h4>Bogoljub Marinkovich, Yugoslavia</h4>
<p>Mathematics Advisor to the Minister for Education</p>
<P>This award was presented by Professor Peter Taylor, President of WFNMC,
at a special ceremony at the <i>Arhimedes</I> premises 
in Belgrade on Tuesday 12 August 2003.</p>

<P>Professors Marinkovic and Taylor after the presentation.</p>
<h4>Citation</h4>
<P>During his lengthy career in mathematics education, Bogoljub 
Marinkovich has served as teacher, educator of teachers, and 
curriculum developer.  He is currently Counsellor for Mathematics at 
the Ministry of Education, where he is responsible for the 
advancement of teaching mathematics in the schools.  His work has 
resulted in significant reforms in the study of mathematics.  He 
initiated, and has for twenty-five years, been Chair of a continuing 
seminar for advanced training of teachers.</p>

<P>Beginning in 1967, he became involved in competitions in primary and 
secondary schools.  Since then, he has maintained a continued 
involvement in competitions at all levels, including the 
International Mathematical Olympiad.</p>

<P>He was founder of <I>Arhimedes</I>, the National Mathematics Competition in 
Serbia, a comprehensive program aimed at identifying bright young 
students and then training them for potential IMO competitions and 
for university studies.</p>

<P>As an extension of the activity, in 1998 the <I>Arhimedes</I> organization 
brought the Tournament of the Towns to Serbia.</p>

<P>He has lectured internationally on the training of teachers, is the 
editor of two popular mathematical journals, and has authored more 
than six hundred publications,</p>

Professor Nikolay Konstantinov (Moscow) centre, with Professors Taylor and
Marinkovic.</p>

<h3>Further Citation from Bogoljub Marinkovic's colleagues, read at the presentation
function in Belgrade</h3>

<h4><I>ARHIMEDES</I></h4>
<h4>BOGOLJUB MARINKOVIC</h4>

<p>Dear guests</p>

<P>We are thankful to you for giving the prestigious Paul Erd&ouml;s award to 
our Bogoljub Marinkovic.</p>

<P>I am expressing the opinion of his colleagues:  you have awarded him for 
his professional, missionary, passionate and devoted work through many 
years standing and his results are great chapters of history of mathematical 
education in our country.</p>

<p>Professor Marinkovic has been devotedly working on improvement of mathematical 
education at primary and secondary schools in Serbia and former Yugoslavia for 
many decades (programmes for teaching, didactic-methodical actions, reduction 
of the gap between proclaimed and everyday teaching practice).</p>

<P>In 1967, he took part in establishing the national contest for primary 
school pupils and he was the President and member of the contest committee at 
all contest levels for many years.  He has written thousands of mathematical 
problems, many of which were used for the first time in our mathematical practice.</p>

<P>Professor Marinkovic was the founder of the Young Mathematics Club and he has 
been leading it successfully for 30 years.  �Arhimedes� has become a specialised 
centre for education and science.  In this centre young people as well as old 
are dealing with mathematics and computer science � the youngest ones who are 
making their first but important steps in the world of mathematics, older 
primary school pupils, secondary school pupils, students, teachers, experts 
of all kinds and academics.</p>

<P>On Professor Marinkovik�s initiative, and under his leadership, <I>Arhimedes</I> has 
been successfully organizing Mathematical Tournament of the primary and 
secondary schools in Serbia (54 tournaments have been organised so far, 
with 2748 teams including 12 184 contestants participating in these tournaments).</p>

<P>Professor Marinkovic succeeded in making Belgrade a part of International 
Mathematical Tournament of Towns.</p>

<P>He enabled the work of the Olympiad group in <I>Arhimedes</I> which means that 
our best young mathematicians, potential candidates for our country�s teams, 
are specially prepared for international mathematical contests.</p>

<P>He founded <I>Arhimedes</I> Mathematical Schools (regular, summer, winter) 
which are held every year.  In these schools 32 300 classes for 30 300 
pupils have been held by now.  There, pupils are instructed in mathematical 
matters which are not offered by regular school practice and they show 
that mathematics can be exciting, unpredictable, elegant and wonderful.</p>

<P>Professor Marinkovic was initiator, and for the first 7 years editor, 
of <I>Mathematical Magazine</I>, the first popular science mathematical magazine 
for primary school pupils in Yugoslavia.  Later on he started two mathematical 
journals in <I>Arhimedes</I> (<I>Mathematical Almanac</I> and <I>Arhimedes</I>) and he 
developed a rich publishing activity which published hundreds of titles 
of reference literature for students and teachers (magazines, thematic 
brochures for young mathematicians, collections of mathematical problems 
and tests, didactic materials, books of history of Serbian mathematics, 
collections of posters and postcards of great mathematicians).</p>

<P>His contribution to the development and organisation of education for 
teachers and professors of mathematics and computer science is very important.</p>

<P>Bogoljub himself held hundreds of lectures, designed and wrote a 
large number of professional works and science-popular add-ins which 
were published as separate publications or in magazines, radio and TV stations.</p>

<P>He gave his personal library, which consisted of 7500 books, to 
<I>Arhimedes</I> and formed an impressive specialised library containing 25 000 
books and thousands of magazines, mostly foreign.  The library is available 
not only to members and co-workers of the club, but to other pupils and teachers 
asking for advice and material for their lectures, seminars and professional 
work as well.</p>

<P>The list of his merits is much longer. Bogoljub Marinkovic has created a 
great and valuable piece of work which cannot be compared to anything else here.</p>

<P>For us, members and his co-workers of <I>Arhimedes</I>, he is the very soul of 
everything that happens in the club.</p>

<P>His colleague Dragana Davidovic describes him as follows:</p>

<P>�Professor Marinkovic is everywhere, where you would expect him and where you 
would not! On the phone � organising.  In front of the computer or behind a 
pile of books � preparing reports and mathematical problems.  At his desk, 
wondering, with a pen in his hand.  Camera and video camera always in 
use. Sharing justice with his red pen. In the post office � sending 
a pile of letters to inform us, or to remind us.  In front of the 
microphone telling the results.  Announcing the success of the 
members of <I>Arhimedes</I> to journalists.  He never rests: his working day 
lasts about 20 hours!�</p>

<P>Professor N.H. Rozov (MGU Moscow) says: �� The surprising thing is that during 
all those years the entire work of the Arhimedes club was organized and directed 
by one man only, who was able to gather an excellent team of enthusiastic colleagues.�</p>

<P>By awarding Bogoljub Marinkovic with the Paul Erd&ouml;s prize, the World 
Federation of National Mathematics Competitions gives acknowledgement to a 
great man for his great results.  And now the list of winners is longer for 
one more great name.</p>
